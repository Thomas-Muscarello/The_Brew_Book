# The_Brew_Book
Keep track of all your brewing recipes!

## Usage
As stated before, the usage of this app is to keep track of all of your brewing recipes.

The Brew Book is a web application that uses a MVC framework. A user is able to sign up by providing at least a username and password. Once the sign up they will be logged in and brought to the welcome screen for current users. Users will notice a navigation bar that provides them a link to see all of their recipes as well as create a new one.

To edit or delete a beer recipe, the user just needs to click on the exact recipe they want to edit/delete, and then click on the edit button at the bottom. This will bring them to the beers/:id/edit erb which will give them the options to edit and save or delete.

To logout the user just needs to click on the logout button on the top right of the screen.


## Installation
To install this app, clone and execute the following: ```bundle install```

Running the App
```shotgun```


## Roadmap
Eventually I can see myself adding to this app that allows the user to input more information such as their sparge temperature as well as batch size. This way it can be more of a log for each batch the brewer makes.
